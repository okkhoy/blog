# My Musings with LaTeX 

I am still learning LaTeX, even after using it for over 5 years now.
In this page, I will record those small things that matter!

## Take care of the small things!

### Enumeration

Native LaTeX supports enumeration and itemization, which suffices for most.
In times when we have to customize enumerations or items there are three packages (that I am aware of!).
- [Enumerate](https://ctan.org/pkg/enumerate)
- [Enumitem](https://ctan.org/pkg/enumitem)
- [Paralist](https://ctan.org/pkg/paralist)
