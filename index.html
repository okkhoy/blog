<p>Hi! I am a PhD candidate at SOC-NUS, working with <a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/%7Eleongty/Home.html">Assoc. Prof. Leong, Tze Yun</a>. I completed MTech from <a href="http://www.iiitb.ac.in/">IIIT-Bangalore</a> in 2012. Prior to MTech I worked with NetApp India Pvt., Ltd., for three years.</p>

<p>I am broadly interested in AI planning, sequential decision making and its applications. My current research is on transfer learning in reinforcement learning using model based approaches. I have explored areas of multi-objective reinforcement learning and hierarchical reinforcement learning during the first couple of years of PhD.</p>

<p>Previously I have worked in the area of cloud computing. Some of the projects include smart metering and charge-back as applied to cloud systems, incorporating power awareness in cloud metering (master's thesis project), workload analysis for virtual machine sizing and location in private clouds (research internship with Infosys labs, India) and QoS monitoring and response in cloud systems.</p>

<p>Some of the other projects I have worked on include building a simulation platform to test crowd-sourcing algorithms (research internship with Xerox Research Center, India) and short text spam detection. </p>
